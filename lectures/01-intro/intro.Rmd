### Brief Description components

  - Introduce the dataset (data type, origin, etc).  Explain why you choose the dataset.  List some questions you want to explore with the dataset.
  
### Mid-term report components

  - Include the brief description with modifications if needed
  
  - Give an abstract on your plan
    
    - What analyses you want to perform for answering your questions

  - Current progress and future plan


### Final report components

  - Introduce the dataset.  Explain why you choose it.  Explain what questions you want to ask and explore using the dataset.
  
  - Analysis.  Explain the statistical methods that you use for analyzing the dataset.  Explain what you have done to generate the results (make your analysis reproducible).
  
  - Results.  Illustrate your results.  Use figures and tables to imiprove readability.
  
  - Discussions.  This is the place to put in almost whatever you want to share.  Some difficulties you met in the analysis, what you learned from the analysis, some future directions.


## Comments from 2020 course evaluations 

From "Additional comments about your experience in this course":

- I learned more from going through the material in the labs than in the actual lectures.
I think that maybe smaller homework assignments more frequently would have been more effective than three huge assignments.

- I thought the course was well organized.
The notes were easy to access for later reference which was really helpful.
I think the only thing that could be improved upon is spending a little less time on learning R and spending more time discussing the theory behind Data Analysis.
Some of the concepts addressed at the end felt rushed and they were the concepts with which I wanted to spend more time.

- Awesome! Professor Ji is very nice. He answered all my confusions. He always explain things clear enough for us to comprehend.

- Dr. Ji is very knowledgeable and goes out of his way to be available as a resource for students needing help with the course or outside R/research/data questions.
He made the structure of the course very flexible without sacrificing rigor, which I think everyone really appreciated during this stressful semester.
I had experience in statistics/R going in, but have improved so much and learned so many new packages and strategies thanks to this course.
I especially benefitted from the homework assignments, which provided practice with skills that I have been able to immediately apply to my research.

From "Comment on the strongest aspects of this course":

- I liked that this class had a lab component. The labs were helpful in making sure that I was understanding the material.

- I received a lot of help from Professor Xiang, who was always was ready to answer my questions in class or through email.

  - Well, Xiang is my first name...
  
- Dr. Ji was by far the best part of the course. He was extremely helpful and prompt with responses to questions. He wanted us to do well in the course.

- Useful in learning R

- This course started from the very basics and covered a lot of information quickly, but was extremely useful and approachable for students coming from different departments with different levels of previous experience.
I really appreciated that the course was tailored towards providing a brief overview of many relevant topics and developing practical skills, rather than memorizing formulas or taking long comprehensive exams.
I would highly recommend taking this course with Dr. Ji to anyone who uses R or wants to start learning.

## Statistics and data science

- Statistics, the science of _data analysis_, is the applied mathematics in the 21st century.

- Data is increasing in [volume, velocity, and variety](http://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2012/01/19/volume-velocity-variety-what-you-need-to-know-about-big-data/).

- My favorite definition of a _data scientist_:

> A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.
