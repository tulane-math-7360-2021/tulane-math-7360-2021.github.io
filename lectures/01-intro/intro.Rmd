## Course logistics

- Course GitHub organization invitation <https://github.com/tulane-math-7360-2021>

  - Go to [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/) to get your student benifit (you need to **use your tulane.edu** email address).
  
  - Once you have got your GitHub id, please tell me through email (xji4@tulane.edu).
  Your GitHub id will then be invited to the [course GitHub organization](https://github.com/tulane-math-7360-2021).
  
  - Project and homework submission via GitHub
  
  - Our course has a GitHub page.
  Please take a look at <https://tulane-math-7360-2021.github.io/> and its source code at
  <https://github.com/tulane-math-7360-2021/tulane-math-7360-2021.github.io>.
  You could check all the development history of this website through the [commit history](https://github.com/tulane-math-7360-2021/tulane-math-7360-2021.github.io/commits/main).

- Lab sessions

  - There will be recordings (not many) in the future.
  
  - *Do* need to submit the lab "work" by pushing it to your Git Repo on the course organization.
  
  - There will be "solutions" posted (after the following Monday lecture) for future lab sessions (when there are questions).

- Using R is a course objective

  - try to use R as much as possible for lab sessions and homework assignments
  
  - free to use any language for course project


- Homework assignment starts week 2.  1st assignment due on week 4.  Expected frequency: one per 2-3 weeks.

- Will provide optional reading material on Course Webpage.

- Github page contains the most up-to-date materials.


## Course Project

  - Find a dataset of interest to you.
  
  - Turn in a brief one-page description by the end of week 3. (points: 3/30)
  
  - Submit a mid-term report (2 - 4 pages, no more than 4 please) by the end of week 12.  (points: 7/30)

## Giant's shoulders

- Previous lecture notes from Dr. Michelle Lacey (Math Department @ Tulane)

- Course material from Dr. Hua Zhou (Biostatistics Department @ UCLA)

- Various online sources

## Statistics and data science

- Statistics, the science of _data analysis_, is the applied mathematics in the 21st century.

- Data is increasing in [volume, velocity, and variety](http://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2012/01/19/volume-velocity-variety-what-you-need-to-know-about-big-data/).

- My favorite definition of a _data scientist_:

> A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.
