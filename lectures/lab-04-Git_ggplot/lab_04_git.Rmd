## Some more Git exercise

1. Please read about [git merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-merge-conflicts)

2. Now read about [resolving a merge conflict using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)

3. Now let's create a merge conflict

```{bash}
# cd to your local git folder
cd ~/GitFolders/Math-7360-Xiang-Ji

# checkout master branch
git checkout main

# list files
ls -lt

# check git status
git status

# check branch
git branch
```

```{bash}
# git pull from remote server first
git pull
```

Let's add what is inside `README.md` and add a new line to the end of the file

```{bash}
# new code chunk moves the working directory back
# If you know a cleaner way, please let me know.
cd ~/GitFolders/Math-7360-Xiang-Ji

head README.md

echo "Our course webpage is on [GitHub](https://tulane-math-7360-2021.github.io/) too!"$'\n' >> README.md

# take a look again
head README.md
```

Now let's commit this change to the master branch

```{bash}
cd ~/GitFolders/Math-7360-Xiang-Ji

git status

# see the difference
git diff README.md

git add README.md

git commit -m 'add line about course webpage to readme'

git push
```

And switch to `develop` branch, work on the same README.md file with different new line

`$'\n'` adds a line break

```{bash}
cd ~/GitFolders/Math-7360-Xiang-Ji

git checkout develop

git pull

git status

git branch

echo "This is our course [webpage](https://tulane-math-7360-2021.github.io/)!"$'\n' >> README.md

git diff README.md

git add README.md

git commit -m 'add a different line for course webpage to readme on develop'

git push

```

Now merge develop branch into master!

```{bash}
cd ~/GitFolders/Math-7360-Xiang-Ji

git checkout main
git pull
```

This should create a conflict for you.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git merge develop
```

> Please fix this merge conflict.
