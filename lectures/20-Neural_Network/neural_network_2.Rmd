- Project mid-report due this week

- HW3 due next week

- Some comments about using code from lecture notes:

  - if it doesn't work for you, please first google the error message
  
  - you may want to compare each object from your run to those from the lecture, e.g. check their dimensions
  
  - come to the office hour (warning: it's commonly considered "rude" to ask other people debug your own code)

## Practical issues

Neural networks are **not a fully automatic tool**, as they are sometimes advertised; as with all statistical models, subject matter knowledge should and often be used to improve their performance.

- Starting values: usually starting values for weights are chosen to be random values near zero; hence the model starts out nearly linear (for sigmoid), and becomes nonlinear as the weights increase.

    [Hanin and Rolnick](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01719) argue that a proper choice of the net and the initial random weights have to meet two requirements:  
    1. Initial weights have carefully chosen variance $\sigma^2$, which controls the mean of the computed weights. The `He uniform` in Keras makes the choice $\sigma^2 = 2 / \text{fan-in}$, where the fan-in is the maximum number of inputs to neurons.    
    2. The hidden layers in the neural net have enough neurons (not too narrow). The layer widths control the variance of the weighs.   

- Scaling of inputs: mean 0 and standard deviation 1. With standardized inputs, it is typical to take random uniform weights over the range [−0.7,+0.7].
    
- Overfitting (too many parameters):
    1. early stopping; 
    2. weight decay by $L_2$ penalty  
    $$
    L(\alpha, \beta) + \frac{\lambda}{2} \left( \sum_{k, m} \beta_{km}^2 + \sum_{m, l} \alpha_{ml}^2 \right).
    $$
    $\lambda$ is the **weight decay parameter**.  
    3. **Dropout**. At each training case, individual nodes are either dropped out of the net with probability $1-p$ or kept with probability $p$, so that a reduced network is left; incoming and outgoing edges to a dropped-out node are also removed. Forward and backpropagation for that training case are done only on this thinned network.

## Convolutional neural networks (CNN)

Sources: <https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Conv-Nets-Modular/>
<p align="center">
![](./fully-vs-locally-connected-network.png){width=500px}
</p>

- **Fully connected networks** don't scale well with dimension of input images. E.g. $1000 \times 1000$ images have about $10^6$ input units, and assuming you want to learn 1 million features (hidden units), you have about $10^{12}$ parameters to learn!

- In **locally connected networks**, each hidden unit only connects to a small contiguous region of pixels in the input, e.g., a patch of image or a time span of the input audio.

- **Convolutions**. Natural images have the property of being **stationary**, meaning that the statistics of one part of the image are the same as any other part. This suggests that the features that we learn at one part of the image can also be applied to other parts of the image, and we can use the same features at all locations by **weight sharing**.
<p align="center">
![](./ufldl-convolution-schematic.gif){width=400px}
</p>

    Consider $96 \times 96$ images. For each feature, first learn a $8 \times 8$ **feature detector** (or **filter** or **kernel**) from (possibly randomly sampled) $8 \times 8$ patches from the larger image. Then apply the learned detector to all $8 \times 8$ regions of the $96 \times 96$ image to obtain one $89 \times 89$ convolved feature for that feature. 
    
    From [Wang and Raj (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.07800.pdf):  
    <p align="center">
    ![](./conv-bridge.png){width=700px}
    </p>
    

- **Pooling**. For a neural network with 100 hidden units, we have $89^2 \times 100 = 792,100$ convolved features. This can be reduced by calculating the mean (or max) value of a particular feature over a region of the image. These summary statistics are much lower in dimension (compared to using all of the extracted features) and can also improve results (less over-fitting). We call this aggregation operation **pooling**, or sometimes **mean pooling** or **max pooling** (depending on the pooling operation applied).

## Example: handwritten digit recognition 

<p align="center">
![](./esl-fig-11-9.png){width=500px}
</p>

- Input: 256 pixel values from $16 \times 16$ grayscale images. Output: 0, 1, ..., 9, 10 class-classification.
    
- A modest experiment subset: 320 training digits and 160 testing digits.
    
- net-1: no hidden layer, equivalent to multinomial logistic regression. Number of parameters is $(16 \times 16 + 1) \times 10 = 2570$.  
net-2: one hidden layer, 12 hidden units fully connected. Number of parameters is $(16 \times 16 + 1) \times 12 + (13 \times 10) = 3214$.  
net-3: two hidden layers locally connected. Each unit of the _first hidden layer_ takes input from a $3 \times 3$ patch; neighboring patches overlap by by one row or column. Each unit of the second hidden layer takes input from a $5 \times 5$ patch; neighboring patches are two units apart. Number of parameters is $(3 \times 3 + 1) \times 64 + (5 \times 5 + 1) \times 16 + (16 + 1) \times 10 = 1226$.  
net-4: two hidden layers, locally connected with weight sharing. $(3 \times 3 + 64) \times 2 +    (5 \times 5 + 1) \times 16 + (16 + 1) * 10 = 1148$ (**???**).   
net-5: two hidden layers, locally connected, two levels of weight sharing (was the result of many person years of experimentation).

Results (320 training cases, 160 test cases):

  | network | links | weights | accuracy |
  |---------|-------|---------|----------|
  | net 1   | 2570  | 2570    | 80.0%    |
  | net 2   | 3124  | 3214    | 87.0%    |
  | net 3   | 1226  | 1226    | 88.5%    |
  | net 4   | 2266  | 1131    | 94.0%    |
  | net 5   | 5194  | 1060    | 98.4%    |  

Net-5 and similar networks were state-of-the-art in early 1990s.

- On the larger benchmark dataset **MNIST** (60,000 training images, 10,000 testing images), accuracies of following methods were reported:

    | Method | Error rate  |
    |--------|----------|
    | tangent distance with 1-nearest neighbor classifier | 1.1% |
    | degree-9 polynomial SVM | 0.8% |
    | LeNet-5 | 0.8% |  
    | boosted LeNet-4 | 0.7% |

- **ResNet** secured 1st Position in ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competition with just error rate of 3.6% of error rate. (Better than Human Performance !!!) Batch Normalization after every conv layer. It also uses Xavier initialization with SGD + Momentum. The learning rate is 0.1 and is divided by 10 as validation error becomes constant. Moreover, batch-size is 256 and weight decay is 1e-5. The important part is there is no dropout is used in ResNet.

- MLP (multi-layer perceptron) and CNN (convolutional neural network) are examples of **feed forward neural network**, where connections between the units do not form a cycle.  

- MLP and CNN accept a fixed-sized vector as input (e.g. an image) and produce a fixed-sized vector as output (e.g. probabilities of different classes). 

- **Reccurent neural networks (RNN)** instead have loops, which can be un-rolled into a sequence of MLP.

- RNNs allow us to operate over sequences of vectors: sequences in the input, the output, or in the most general case both.

- Applications of RNN:

    </p>

- RNNs accept an input vector $x$ and give you an output vector $y$. However, crucially this output vector’s contents are influenced not only by the input you just fed in, but also on the entire history of inputs you’ve fed in the past.

<!-- - How much is CPU usage? Are all cores being used? -->

<!-- - Is training loss monotone? Is validation loss monotone? Is testing error monotone? -->
