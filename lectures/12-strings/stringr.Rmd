# Announcement

- Oliver's question from last lecture: how to supply arguments to functions inside `across`

  - Take a look at the documentation of `across` [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html)
  
  - Notice the `...` and the `.fns` input formats
  
    - A purrr-style lambda (?), e.g. `~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)`
    
    - `purrr` package [documentation](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/articles/other-langs.html)
    
    - Anonymous functions are verbose in R, so we provide two convenient shorthands.
    
      - For unary functions,`~ .x + 1` is equivalent to `function(.x) .x + 1`.
      
      - For chains of transformations functions, `. %>% f() %>% g()` is equivalent to `function(.) . %>% f() %>% g()` (this shortcut is provided by magrittr).
    ```{r}
    library(nycflights13)
    test.case.1 <- flights %>%
      transmute(across(1:4, list(log = log, log2 = log2)))
    
    test.case.2 <- flights %>%
      transmute(across(1:4, list(log = log, log.2.base = ~ log(.x, base = 2))))
    
    test.case.3 <- flights %>%
      transmute(across(1:4, list(log = log, log.2.base = function(.x) log(.x, base = 2))))
    
    all(test.case.1 == test.case.2, na.rm = TRUE)
    all(test.case.1 == test.case.3, na.rm = TRUE)
    ```
- HW2 questions

  - For problem 2 of Homework 2, are the two datasets we need to link “Louisiana-history.csv” and “CRDT Data -CRDT.csv”? Also, does linking mean combining the two datasets or just plotting them on the same graph for comparison?
    
    - No, the two datasets refer to the two data sources: (1) Louisiana Department of Health (2) The COVID tracking project
    
    - Both data sources have daily counts.  Please compare them with whatever visualization methods you see fit.
    
  - ...about Q3, the question says that “Recreate the 4 plots with 7-day average of Full range”, does this mean that I need to create a new table transfer the “by day” data to “by week”? Or there already have the dataset on website I can use.
  
    - Presumably, you should have the same amount of information as in the figures from the downloaded files.  The question is asking you to present the information in the same fashion as on the website.  I expect you to find answers about using "by day" or "by week" summaries through investigating the four figures, after all, you are asked to recreate them.
    
    - There are choices for "State-level Metrics" (Total vs Per 1M people, Last 90 days vs Historical).  Feel free to pick one (enough for the homework) or several or all combinations for your plots.
    


# String | r4ds chapter 14

## stringr

- stringr pacakge, by Hadley Wickham, provides utilities for handling strings.

- Included in tidyverse.
    ```{r}
    library("tidyverse")
    ```
    ```{r}
    # load htmlwidgets
    library(htmlwidgets)
    ```

- Main functions:    
    - `str_detect(string, pattern)`: Detect the presence or absence of a pattern in a string.  
    - `str_locate(string, pattern)`: Locate the first position of a pattern and return a matrix with start and end.  
    - `str_extract(string, pattern)`: Extracts text corresponding to the first match.  
    - `str_match(string, pattern)`: Extracts capture groups formed by () from the first match.  
    - `str_split(string, pattern)`: Splits string into pieces and returns a list of character vectors.  
    - `str_replace(string, pattern, replacement)`: Replaces the first matched pattern and returns a character vector.
    
- Variants with an `_all` suffix will match more than 1 occurrence of the pattern in a given string.  

- Most functions are vectorized.
    

## Basics

- Strings are enclosed by double quotes or single quotes:
    ```{r}
    string1 <- "This is a string"
    string2 <- 'If I want to include a "quote" inside a string, I use single quotes'
    ```

- Literal single or double quote:
    ```{r}
    double_quote <- "\"" # or '"'
    single_quote <- '\'' # or "'"
    ```

----

- Printed representation:
    ```{r}
    x <- c("\"", "\\")
    x
    ```
vs `cat`:    
    ```{r}
    cat(x)
    ```
vs `writeLines()`:
    ```{r}
    writeLines(x)
    ```
    
----    

- Other special characters: `"\n"` (new line), `"\t"` (tab), ... Check
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ?"'"
    ```
for a complete list.
    ```{r}
    cat("a\"b")
    cat("a\tb")
    cat("a\nb")
    ```

- Unicode
    ```{r}
    x <- "\u00b5"
    x
    ```

- Character vector (vector of strings):
    ```{r}
    c("one", "two", "three")
    ```

## String length

- Length of a single string:
    ```{r}
    str_length("R for data science")
    ```

- Lengths of a character vector:
    ```{r}
    str_length(c("a", "R for data science", NA))
    ```

## Combining strings

- Read `str_c`'s [documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stringr/versions/1.4.0/topics/str_c)

- Combine two or more strings
    ```{r}
    str_c("x", "y")
    str_c("x", "y", "z")
    ```

- Separator:
    ```{r}
    str_c("x", "y", sep = ", ")
    ```

----

- `str_c()` is vectorised:
    ```{r}
    str_c("prefix-", c("a", "b", "c"), "-suffix")
    ```

- Objects of length 0 are silently dropped:
    ```{r}
    name <- "Hadley"
    time_of_day <- "morning"
    birthday <- FALSE
    
    str_c(
      "Good ", time_of_day, " ", name,
      if (birthday) " and HAPPY BIRTHDAY",
      "."
    )
    ```

----

- Combine a vector of strings:
    ```{r}
    str_c(c("x", "y", "z"))
    str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), collapse = ", ")
    ```
    
## Subsetting strings

- `str_sub`'s [documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stringr/versions/1.4.0/topics/str_sub)

- By position:
    ```{r}
    str_sub("Apple", 1, 3)
    x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
    str_sub(x, 1, 3)
    ```

- Negative numbers count backwards from end:
    ```{r}
    str_sub(x, -3, -1)
    ```

----

- Out of range:
    ```{r}
    str_sub("a", 1, 5)
    str_sub("a", 2, 5)
    ```

- Assignment to a substring:
    ```{r}
    str_sub(x, 1, 1) <- str_to_lower(str_sub(x, 1, 1))
    x
    ```

## Matching patterns with regular expressions

- `str_view()` shows the first match;  
`str_view_all()` shows all matches.

- Match exact strings:
    ```{r}
    x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
    str_view(x, "an")
    str_view_all(x, "an")
    ```

----

- `.` matches any character apart from a newline:
    ```{r}
    str_view(x, ".a.")
    ```

- **Regex escapes live on top of regular string escapes, so there needs to be two levels of escapes.**.  
    To match a literal `.`:
    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    # doesn't work because "a\.c" is treated as a regular expression
    str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\.c")
    ```
    ```{r}
    # regular expression needs double escape
    str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\\.c")
    ```
    To match a literal `\`:
    ```{r}
    str_view("a\\b", "\\\\")
    ```

</p>


## Anchors

- List of typographical symbols and punctuation marks [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typographical_symbols_and_punctuation_marks)

- `^` matches the start of the string:
    ```{r}
    x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
    str_view(x, "^a")
    ```

- `$` matches the end of the string:
    ```{r}
    str_view(x, "a$")
    ```

----

- To force a regular expression to only match a complete string:
    ```{r}
    x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
    str_view(x, "^apple$")
    ```

----

- Alternation  
    - `[abc]`: matches a, b, or c. Same as `(a|b|c)`.
    - `[^abc]`: matches anything except a, b, or c.
    ```{r}
    str_view(c("grey", "gray"), "gr(e|a)y")
    ```
    ```{r}
    str_view(c("grey", "gray"), "gr[ea]y")
    ```
    
## Repetition

- 
`?`: 0 or 1  
`+`: 1 or more  
`*`: 0 or more

- 
    ```{r}
    x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
    # match either C or CC, being greedy here
    str_view(x, "CC?")
    # greedy matches
    str_view(x, "CC+")
    # greedy matches
    str_view(x, 'C[LX]+')
    ```
    
----

- Specify number of matches:  
`{n}`: exactly n   
`{n,}`: n or more  
`{,m}`: at most m  
`{n,m}`: between n and m

-
    ```{r}
    str_view(x, "C{2}")
    # greedy matches
    str_view(x, "C{2,}")
    # greedy matches
    str_view(x, "C{2,3}")
    ```

----

- Greedy (default) vs lazy (put `?` after repetition):
    ```{r}
    # lazy matches
    str_view(x, 'C{2,3}?')
    # lazy matches
    str_view(x, 'C[LX]+?')
    ```
    
- What went wrong here?
    ```{r}
    text = "<div class='main'> <div> <a href='here.pdf'>Here!</a> </div> </div>"
    str_extract(text, "<div>.*</div>")
    ```
    If we add ? after a quantifier, the matching will be lazy (find the shortest possible match, not the longest).
    ```{r}
    str_extract(text, "<div>.*?</div>")
    ```

## Grouping and backreference

<!-- - Group together parts of a regular expression for modification or capture. -->
<!--     - `(a|b)`: match literal a or b, group either   -->
<!--     - `a(bc)`: match literal a or abc, group bc or ""   -->
<!--     - `(?:abc)`: non-capturing group   -->
<!--     - `(abc)def(hig)`: match abcdefhig, group abc and hig -->

<!-- - Example -->
<!--     ```{r} -->
<!--     text = c("Bob Smith", "Alice Smith", "Apple") -->
<!--     str_extract(text, "^[:alpha:]+") -->
<!--     str_match(text, "^([:alpha:]+) [:alpha:]+") -->
<!--     str_match(text, "^([:alpha:]+) ([:alpha:]+)") -->
<!--     ``` -->

- `fruit` is a character vector pre-defined in `stringr` package:
    ```{r}
    fruit
    ```

- Parentheses define groups, which can be back-referenced as `\1`, `\2`, ...
    ```{r}
    # only show matched strings
    str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
    ```
    
## Detect matches

- 
    ```{r}
    x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
    str_detect(x, "e")
    ```

- Vector `words` contains about 1000 commonly used words:
    ```{r}
    length(words)
    head(words)
    ```

----

- 
    ```{r}
    # How many common words start with t?
    sum(str_detect(words, "^t"))
    # What proportion of common words end with a vowel?
    mean(str_detect(words, "[aeiou]$"))
    ```
    
----

- Find words that end with `x`:
    ```{r}
    words[str_detect(words, "x$")]
    ```
same as
    ```{r}
    str_subset(words, "x$")
    ```
    
----

- Filter a data frame:
    ```{r}
    df <- tibble(
      word = words, 
      i = seq_along(word)
    )
    df %>% 
      filter(str_detect(words, "x$"))
    ```

----

- `str_count()` tells how many matches are found:
    ```{r}
    x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
    str_count(x, "a")
    ```
    ```{r}
    # On average, how many vowels per word?
    mean(str_count(words, "[aeiou]"))
    ```

- Matches never overlap:
    ```{r}
    str_count("abababa", "aba")
    str_view_all("abababa", "aba")
    ```

----

- Mutate a data frame:
    ```{r}
    df %>% 
      mutate(
        vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
        consonants = str_count(word, "[^aeiou]")
      )
    ```

## Extract matches

- `sentences` is a collection of 720 phrases:
    ```{r}
    length(sentences)
    head(sentences)
    ```
    
- Suppose we want to find all sentences that contain a colour.

----

- Create a collection of colours:
    ```{r}
    (colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"))
    ```

    ```{r}
    (colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|"))
    ```


- Select the sentences that contain a colour, and then extract the colour to figure out which one it is:    
    ```{r}
    (has_colour <- str_subset(sentences, colour_match))
    ```

    ```{r}
    (matches <- str_extract(has_colour, colour_match))
    ```


----

- `str_extract()` only extracts the first match.

-
    ```{r}
    more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
    str_view_all(more, colour_match)
    ```

- `str_extract_all()` extracts all matches:
    ```{r}
    str_extract_all(more, colour_match)
    ```

----

- Setting `simplify = TRUE` in `str_extract_all()` will return a matrix with short matches expanded to the same length as the longest:
    ```{r}
    str_extract_all(more, colour_match, simplify = TRUE)
    ```
    ```{r}
    x <- c("a", "a b", "a b c")
    str_extract_all(x, "[a-z]", simplify = TRUE)
    ```

## Grouped matches

- `str_extract()` gives us the complete match:
    ```{r}
    # why "([^ ]+)" match a word?
    noun <- "(a|the) ([^ ]+)"

    has_noun <- sentences %>%
      str_subset(noun) %>%
      head(10)
    has_noun %>%
      str_extract(noun)
    ```

----

- `str_match()` gives each individual component:
    ```{r}
    has_noun %>%
      str_match(noun)
    ```

----

- `tidyr::extract()` works with tibble:
    ```{r}
    tibble(sentence = sentences) %>%
      tidyr::extract(
        sentence, c("article", "noun"), "(a|the) ([^ ]+)",
        remove = FALSE
      )
    ```
    
## Replacing matches

- Replace the first match:
    ```{r}
    x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
    str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
    ```

- Replace all matches:
    ```{r}
    str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
    ```

- Multiple replacement:
    ```{r}
    x <- c("1 house", "2 cars", "3 people")
    str_replace_all(x, c("1" = "one", "2" = "two", "3" = "three"))
    ```

----

- Back-reference:
    ```{r}
    # flip the order of the second and third words
    sentences %>% 
      str_replace("([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+)", "\\1 \\3 \\2") %>% 
      head(5)
    ```

## Splitting

- Split a string up into pieces:
    ```{r}
    sentences %>%
      head(5) %>% 
      str_split(" ")
    ```

----
    
- Use `simplify = TRUE` to return a matrix:    
    ```{r}
    sentences %>%
      head(5) %>% 
      str_split(" ", simplify = TRUE)
    ```
    
# More regular expressions

## Character classes

<p align="center">
<img src="./regex_characterclass.png" height="150">
</p>

- A number of built-in convenience classes of characters:
    - `.`: Any character except new line `\n`.
    - `\s`: White space.  
    - `\S`: Not white space.  
    - `\d`: Digit (0-9). 
    - `\D`: Not digit.
    - `\w`: Word (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _).
    - `\W`: Not word.
    
- Example: How to match a telephone number with the form (###) ###-####?
    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    text = c("apple", "(219) 733-8965", "(329) 293-8753")
    str_detect(text, "(\d\d\d) \d\d\d-\d\d\d\d")
    ```
    ```{r}
    text = c("apple", "(219) 733-8965", "(329) 293-8753")
    str_detect(text, "(\\d\\d\\d) \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d")
    str_detect(text, "\\(\\d\\d\\d\\) \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d")
    ```

## Lists and ranges

- Lists and ranges:
    - `[abc]`: List (a or b or c)  
    - `[^abc]`: Excluded list (not a or b or c)  
    - `[a-q]`: Range lower case letter from a to q  
    - `[A-Q]`: Range upper case letter from A to Q  
    - `[0-7]`: Digit from 0 to 7  

    ```{r}
    text = c("apple", "(219) 733-8965", "(329) 293-8753")
    str_replace_all(text, "[aeiou]", "") # strip all vowels
    str_replace_all(text, "[13579]", "*")
    str_replace_all(text, "[1-5a-ep]", "*")
    ```
