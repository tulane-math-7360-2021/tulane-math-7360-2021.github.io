## Why Shiny?

- Better presentations of data and ideas!
    - One of the most critical skills for data scientists.

- Browse the [Gallery](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) of Shiny apps.

- Shiny is a framework for creating web applications using R code.

  - No prior knowledge required for HTML, CSS or JavaScript

## Interactive documents

R Markdown documents can also generate interactive content.
There are two types of interactive R Markdown documents:

- the HTML Widgets framework

- the Shiny framework

### HTML widgets

The HTML Widgets framework is implemented in the R package `htmlwidgets`, interfacing JavaScript libraries that create interactive applications, such as interactive graphics and tables.

Several widget packages have been developed based on this framework

- `DT`

- `leaflet`

- `dygraphs`

Visit [https://www.htmlwidgets.org/](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) for more HTMLwidgets for R.

```{r out.width='100%', echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
  setView(-90.12274999048809, 29.93538150744488, zoom = 17) %>%
  addPopups(
    -90.12274999048809, 29.93538150744488,
    'Here is the <b>Department of Mathematics</b>, Tulane University'
  )
```

### Shiny documents

The `shiny` package builds interactive web apps powered by R.

To call Shiny code from an R Markdown document, add `runtime: shiny` to the YAML metadata, like in this document.

## Inputs and outputs 

Recall Diamonds is a data set available from ggplot2.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
diamonds
```

### Numeric input, table output

To dynamically display the first rows:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
numericInput("rows", "How many diamonds?", 5)

renderTable({
  head(diamonds, input$rows)
})
```

### Slider input, plot output

To dynamically tune the histogram of variable `carat`:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", min = 1, max = 300, value = 30)

renderPlot({
  ggplot(data = diamonds) +
    geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), bins = input$bins)
})
```

## Building a Shiny app

Shiny app is a standalone app. 

- Basic parts of a shiny app: <http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/basics.html>

- How to build a shiny app: <http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/build.html>

- How to launch a shiny app: <http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/running.html>

----

- Skeleton of a Shiny app:
    ```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    library(shiny)
    ui <- fluidPage()
    server <- function(input, output) {}
    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
    ```

- A Shiny app has 3 components:

    1. `ui`: assemble the HTML user interface for your app.

    2. `server`: a function with instructions on how to build and rebuild the R objects displayed in the UI.

    3. `shinyApp`: combines `ui` and `server` into an app.

## Shiny app: first example

- In RStudio, `File` -> `New File` -> `Shiny Web App...` creates a demo Shiny app using the `faithful` data set in base R. Recall the `faithful` data
    ```{r}
    head(faithful)
    ```

## Shiny app: censusVis

- This example is from tutorial: <http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson5/>

- `counties.rds` contains demographic data for each county in the United States from 2010 census:
    ```{r}
    counties <- readRDS("census-app/data/counties.rds")
    head(counties)
    ```

----

- Use `maps` package, `mapproj` package and `helpers.R` file to plot maps:
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(maps)
    library(mapproj)
    source("census-app/helpers.R")
    percent_map(counties$white, "darkgreen", "% White")
    ```

----

- Shiny app.
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    #setwd("census-app")
    #shinyAppDir(getwd())
    #shinyAppDir("census-app")
    #source("./census-app/app.R")
    runApp("census-app")
    ```

- [Code](https://github.com/tulane-math-7360-2021/tulane-math-7360-2021.github.io/tree/master/lectures/14-shiny/census-app) for the Shiny app `census-app`.

Let's take a closer look at the `census-app` code:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load packages ----
library(shiny)
library(maps)
library(mapproj)

# Source helper functions -----
source("helpers.R")

# Load data ----
counties <- readRDS("data/counties.rds")

# User interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("censusVis"),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      helpText("Create demographic maps with 
               information from the 2010 US Census."),
      
      selectInput("var", 
                  label = "Choose a variable to display",
                  choices = c("Percent White", "Percent Black",
                              "Percent Hispanic", "Percent Asian"),
                  selected = "Percent White"),
      
      sliderInput("range", 
                  label = "Range of interest:",
                  min = 0, max = 100, value = c(0, 100))
    ),
    
    mainPanel(plotOutput("map"))
  )
)

# Server logic ----
# server function is run once each time a user visits the app
server <- function(input, output) {
  # renderPlot is run once each time a user changes a widget that output$map depends on
  output$map <- renderPlot({
    data <- switch(input$var, 
                   "Percent White" = counties$white,
                   "Percent Black" = counties$black,
                   "Percent Hispanic" = counties$hispanic,
                   "Percent Asian" = counties$asian)
    
    color <- switch(input$var, 
                    "Percent White" = "darkgreen",
                    "Percent Black" = "black",
                    "Percent Hispanic" = "darkorange",
                    "Percent Asian" = "darkviolet")
    
    legend <- switch(input$var, 
                     "Percent White" = "% White",
                     "Percent Black" = "% Black",
                     "Percent Hispanic" = "% Hispanic",
                     "Percent Asian" = "% Asian")
    
    percent_map(data, color, legend, input$range[1], input$range[2])
  })
}

# Run app ----
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

----

- The `shinyApp` function is run once, when you launch your app.  
- The `server` function is run once each time a user visits your app.  
- The R expressions inside `render*` functions are run many times. Shiny runs them once each time a user change the value of a widget. 
- Source scripts, load libraries, and read data sets at the beginning of `app.R` outside of the `server` function. Shiny will only run this code once, which is all you need to set your server up to run the R expressions contained in server.  
- Define user specific objects inside `server` function, but outside of any `render*` calls. These would be objects that you think each user will need their own personal copy of. For example, an object that records the userâ€™s session information. This code will be run once per user.

## Shiny app: reactive expressions

- This example is from tutorial: <http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson6/>

- [Code](https://github.com/tulane-math-7360-2021/tulane-math-7360-2021.github.io/tree/master/lectures/14-shiny/stockVis) for the Shiny app `stockVis`.

---

- Without using reactive expression:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    output$plot <- renderPlot({
      data <- getSymbols(input$symb, src = "yahoo",
                         from = input$dates[1],
                         to = input$dates[2],
                         auto.assign = FALSE)
    
      chartSeries(data, theme = chartTheme("white"),
                  type = "line", log.scale = input$log, TA = NULL)
    })
    ```
Each time `renderPlot` re-runs:  
1. it re-fetches the data from Yahoo Finance with `getSymbols`, and
2. it re-draws the chart with the correct axis.

---- 

- With **reactive expression**:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    dataInput <- reactive({
      getSymbols(input$symb, src = "yahoo", 
                 from = input$dates[1],
                 to = input$dates[2],
                 auto.assign = FALSE)
    })
    
    output$plot <- renderPlot({
      chartSeries(dataInput(), theme = chartTheme("white"), 
                  type = "line", log.scale = input$log, TA = NULL)
    })
    ```

- A reactive expression saves its result the first time you run it.

- The next time the reactive expression is called, it checks if the saved value has become out of date (i.e., whether the widgets it depends on have changed).

- If the value is out of date, the reactive object will recalculate it (and then save the new result).

- If the value is up-to-date, the reactive expression will return the saved value without doing any computation.
