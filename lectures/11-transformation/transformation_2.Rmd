```{r}
rm(list = ls()) # clean-up workspace
library("tidyverse")
library("nycflights13")
```

## Add new variables with `mutate()`

- Add variables `gain` and `speed`:
    ```{r}
    flights_sml <- 
      select(flights, year:day, ends_with("delay"), distance, air_time)
    flights_sml
    ```
    ```{r}
    mutate(flights_sml,
      gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
      speed = distance / air_time * 60
    )
    ```

----

- Refer to columns that you’ve just created:
    ```{r}
    mutate(flights_sml,
      gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
      hours = air_time %/% 60,
      minute = air_time %% 60,
      gain_per_hour = gain / (hours + minute / 60)
    )
    ```


Modular arithmetic: `%/%` (integer division) and `%%` (remainder).

----

- Only keep the new variables by `transmute()`:
    ```{r}
    transmute(flights,
      gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
      hours = air_time %/% 60,
      minute = air_time %% 60,
      gain_per_hour = gain / (hours + minute / 60)
    )
    ```

----

- `across()`: apply a function (or a set of functions) to a set of columns
    ```{r}
    flights %>%
      transmute(across(1:4, list(log = log, log2 = log2)))
    ```

-  apply funs of one type
    ```{r}
    flights %>%
      filter(dep_delay > 0 & arr_delay > 0) %>%
      transmute(across(where(is.numeric), log))
    ```

# Summaries

`summarise()` collapses a data frame to a single row.

- Not very useful unless paired with `group_by()`.

- `group_by()` changes the unit of the analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups.

- Mean of a variable:
    ```{r}
    (by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day))
    summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
    ```

----
 
- Convert a tibble into a grouped tibble:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    (by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day))
    ```
    
----

- Grouped summaries:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
    ```

## Pipe

- Consider following analysis:
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
    delay <- summarise(by_dest, count = n(),
      dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
      delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
    delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dest != "HNL")
    delay
    ```
    
    - `n()` count for each sub-group

    - `sum(!is.na(x))` counts for all non-missing values

----

- Cleaner code using pipe `%>%`:
    ```{r}
    delays <- flights %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      summarise(
        count = n(),
        dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
        delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
      ) %>% 
      filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
    delays
    ```
    
----

- ggplot2 accepts pipe too.
    ```{r}
    delays %>%
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
      geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

## Other summary functions

- Measures of Location: `mean(x)`, `median(x)`.
    ```{r}
    not_cancelled <- flights %>% filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
    not_cancelled
    ```
    ```{r}
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
      summarise(
        avg_delay = mean(arr_delay),
        avg_pos_delay = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay > 0]) # the average positive delay
      )
    ```
    
----

- Measures of Spread: `sd(x)`, `IQR(x)`, `mad(x)`.

    - `sd()` standard deviation
    
    - `IQR()` interquartile range
    
    - `mad()` median absolute deviation


    ```{r}
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      summarise(distance_sd = sd(distance)) %>% 
      arrange(desc(distance_sd))
    ```

----
    
- Measures of Rank: `min(x)`, `quantile(x, 0.25)`, `max(x)`.
    ```{r}
    # When do the first and last flights leave each day?
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
      summarise(
        first = min(dep_time),
        last = max(dep_time)
      )
    ```

----

- Measures of Position: `first(x)`, `nth(x, 2)`, `last(x)`.
    ```{r}
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
      summarise(
        first_dep = first(dep_time), 
        last_dep = last(dep_time)
      )
    ```

----

- Count: `n(x)`, `sum(!is.na(x))`, `n_distinct(x)`.
    ```{r}
    # Which destinations have the most carriers?
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      summarise(carriers = n_distinct(carrier)) %>% 
      arrange(desc(carriers))
    ```

----

- 
    ```{r}
    not_cancelled %>% 
      count(dest)
    ```

---- 

- 
    ```{r}
    # total number of miles a plane flew
    not_cancelled %>% 
      count(tailnum, wt = distance)
    ```

----

-
    ```{r}
    # How many flights left before 5am? (these usually indicate delayed
    # flights from the previous day)
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
      summarise(n_early = sum(dep_time < 500))
    ```

----

-
    ```{r}
    # What proportion of flights are delayed by more than an hour?
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
      summarise(hour_perc = mean(arr_delay > 60))
    ```

## Grouped mutates (and filters)

- Recall the `flights_sml` tibble created earlier:
    ```{r}
    flights_sml
    ```

- Find the worst members of each group:
    ```{r}
    flights_sml %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>%
      filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) < 10)
    ```
    
----

- Find all groups bigger than a threshold:
    ```{r}
    (popular_dests <- flights %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      filter(n() > 365))
    ```
    
----

- Standardise to compute per group metrics:
    ```{r}
    popular_dests %>% 
      filter(arr_delay > 0) %>% 
      mutate(prop_delay = arr_delay / sum(arr_delay)) %>% 
      select(year:day, dest, arr_delay, prop_delay)
    ```


# Combine tables | r4ds chapter 13

nycflights13 package has >1 tables:

- We already know a lot about flights:
    ```{r}
    flights %>% print(width = Inf)
    ```

----

- airlines:
    ```{r}
    airlines
    ```

----

- airports:
    ```{r}
    airports
    ```

----

- planes:
    ```{r}
    planes
    ```

----

- Weather:
    ```{r}
    weather
    ```

## Relational data

<p align="center">
<img src="./relational-nycflights.png" height="375">
</p>

## Keys

- A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table.

    - single variable, e.g., `tailnum` for each plane
    
    - multiple variables, e.g., `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin` to identify an observation in `weather`

- A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another table.

Good practice: verify the primary keys by using `count()`

```{r}
planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

weather %>% 
  count(year, month, day, hour, origin) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

# Combine variables (columns)

## Demo tables

-
    ```{r}
    (x <- tribble(
      ~key, ~val_x,
         1, "x1",
         2, "x2",
         3, "x3"
    ))
    ```
    ```{r}
    (y <- tribble(
      ~key, ~val_y,
         1, "y1",
         2, "y2",
         4, "y3"
    ))
    ```

## Inner join

- An **inner join** matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal:

<p align="center">
<img src="./join-inner.png" height="150">
</p>

- 
    ```{r}
    inner_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```
Same as
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    x %>% inner_join(y, by = "key")
    ```

Generally not appropriate for use because of loss of observations

## Outer join

- An **outer join** keeps observations that appear in at least one of the tables. 

- Three types of outer joins:

    - A **left join** keeps all observations in `x`.
    ```{r}
    left_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```

    - A **right join** keeps all observations in `y`.
    ```{r}
    right_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```
    
    - A **full join** keeps all observations in `x` or `y`.
    ```{r}
    full_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```
    
    <p align="center">
    <img src="./join-outer.png" height="275">
    </p>
    
## Duplicate keys

- One table has duplicate keys.

    <p align="center">
    <img src="./join-one-to-many.png" height="200">
    </p>
    
----    

- 
    ```{r}
    x <- tribble(
      ~key, ~val_x,
         1, "x1",
         2, "x2",
         2, "x3",
         1, "x4"
    )
    y <- tribble(
      ~key, ~val_y,
         1, "y1",
         2, "y2"
    )
    left_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```

----

- Both tables have duplicate keys. You get all possible combinations, the Cartesian product:

    <p align="center">
    <img src="./join-many-to-many.png" height="250">
    </p>

----

- 
    ```{r}
    x <- tribble(
      ~key, ~val_x,
         1, "x1",
         2, "x2",
         2, "x3",
         3, "x4"
    )
    y <- tribble(
      ~key, ~val_y,
         1, "y1",
         2, "y2",
         2, "y3",
         3, "y4"
    )
    left_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```

----

- Let's create a narrower table from the flights data:
    ```{r}
    flights2 <- flights %>% 
      select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
    flights2
    ```

- We want to merge with the `weather` table:
    ```{r}
    weather
    ```

## Defining the key columns

- `by = NULL` (default): use all variables that appear in both tables:
    ```{r}
    # same as: flights2 %>% left_join(weather)
    left_join(flights2, weather)
    ```

----

- `by = "x"`: use the common variable `x`:
    ```{r}
    # same as: flights2 %>% left_join(weather)
    left_join(flights2, planes, by = "tailnum")
    ```

----

- `by = c("a" = "b")`: match variable `a` in table `x` to the variable `b` in table `y`.
    ```{r}
    # same as: flights2 %>% left_join(weather)
    left_join(flights2, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
    ```

# Combine cases (rows)

----

- Top 10 most popular destinations:
    ```{r}
    top_dest <- flights %>%
      count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
      head(10)
    top_dest
    ```
    
- How to filter the cases that fly to these destinations?     
    
## Semi-join

- `semi_join(x, y)` keeps the rows in `x` that have a match in `y`.

    <p align="center">
    <img src="./join-semi.png" height="200">
    </p>

- Useful to see what will be joined.

----

-
    ```{r}
    semi_join(flights, top_dest)
    ```

## Anti-join

- `anti_join(x, y)` keeps the rows that don’t have a match.

    <p align="center">
    <img src="./join-anti.png" height="200">
    </p>

- Useful to see what will not be joined.

----

-
    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
      count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)
    ```

## Set operations

1. All these operations work with a complete row, comparing the values of every variable.

2. These operations expect the `x` and `y` inputs to have the same variables.


- Generate two tables:
    ```{r}
    (df1 <- tribble(
      ~x, ~y,
       1,  1,
       2,  1
    ))
    ```
    ```{r}
    (df2 <- tribble(
      ~x, ~y,
       1,  1,
       1,  2
    ))
    ```

----

- `bind_rows(x, y)` stacks table `x` on top of `y`. 
    ```{r}
    bind_rows(df1, df2)
    ```

- `intersect(x, y)` returns rows that appear in both `x` and `y`.
    ```{r}
    intersect(df1, df2)
    ```

----

- `union(x, y)` returns unique observations in `x` and `y`.
    ```{r}
    union(df1, df2)
    ```

----

- `setdiff(x, y)` returns rows that appear in `x` but not in `y`.
    ```{r}
    setdiff(df1, df2)
    ```
    ```{r}
    setdiff(df2, df1)
    ```
