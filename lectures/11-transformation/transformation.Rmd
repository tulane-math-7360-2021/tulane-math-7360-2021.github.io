## nycflights13 data

- Available from the nycflights13 package. 

- 336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013:
    ```{r}
    library("tidyverse")
    library("nycflights13")
    flights
    ```

- To display more rows:
    ```{r}
    flights %>% print(n = 20)
    ```
  Note `%>%` is the pipe is tidyverse. Above command is equivalent to `print(flights, n = 20)`.

- To display all rows:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    flights %>% print(n = nrow(.))
    ```
    Do **not** try this on the `flights` data, which has too many rows.
    
- To display more columns (variables):
    ```{r}
    flights %>% print(width = Inf)
    ```
    The `width` argument controls the screen width.

## dplyr basics

* Pick observations (rows) by their values: `filter()`.

* Reorder the rows: `arrange()`.

* Pick variables (columns) by their names: `select()`.

* Create new variables with functions of existing variables: `mutate()`.

* Collapse many values down to a single summary: `summarise()`.

in conjunction with __`group_by()`__ changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group.

# Manipulate rows (cases)

## Filter rows with `filter()`

- Flights on Jan 1st:
    ```{r}
    # same as filter(flights, month == 1 & day == 1)
    filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
    ```

----

- Flights in Nov or Dec:
    ```{r}
    filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
    ```
    
    equavalent as
    ```{r}
    filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
    ```

## Missing values

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values.

If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly
```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

## Remove rows with duplicate values

- One row from each month:
    ```{r}
    distinct(flights, month, .keep_all = TRUE)
    ```
    
- With `.keep_all = FALSE`, only distinct values of the variable are selected:
    ```{r}
    distinct(flights, month)
    ```

## Sample rows

- Randomly select `n` rows:
    ```{r}
    slice_sample(flights, n = 10, replace = TRUE)
    ```

----

- Randomly select fraction of rows:
    ```{r}
    slice_sample(flights, prop = 0.1, replace = TRUE)
    ```

## Select rows by position

- Select rows by position:
    ```{r}
    slice(flights, 1:5)
    ```

----

- Top `n` rows:
    ```{r}
    slice_head(flights, n = 5)
    ```
    Use `prop` argument to specify proportions instead
    
- Bottom `n` rows:
    ```{r}
    slice_tail(flights, n = 5)
    ```

## Arrange rows with `arrange()`

- Sort in ascending order:
    ```{r}
    arrange(flights, year, month, day)
    ```

----

- Sort in descending order:
    ```{r}
    arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
    ```

Missing values are always sorted at the end.

# Manipulate columns (variables)

## Select columns with `select()`

- Select columns by variable name:
    ```{r}
    select(flights, year, month, day)
    ```

- Pull values of _one_ column as a vector:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    pull(flights, year)
    ```

----

- Select all columns between two variables (inclusive):
    ```{r}
    select(flights, year:day)
    ```

----

- Select all columns _except_ those between two variables:
    ```{r, }
    select(flights, -(year:day))
    ```

  Read the documentation of `select` to learn more about allowed operations:
    
    - `:` for selecting a range of consecutive variables
    
    - `!` for taking the complement of a set of variables
    
    - `&` and `|` for selecting the intersection or the union of two sets of variables
    
    - `c()` for combining selections
    

----

- Select columns by positions:
    ```{r}
    select(flights, seq(1, 10, by = 2))
    ```

----

- Move variables to the start of data frame:
    ```{r, }
    select(flights, time_hour, air_time, everything())
    ```

----
 
- Helper functions.

    * `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with “abc”.

    * `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with “xyz”.

    * `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain “ijk”.

    * `matches("(.)\\1")`: selects variables that match a regular expression.

    * `num_range("x", 1:3)`: matches x1, x2 and x3.
    
    * `one_of()`

## Add new variables with `mutate()`

- Add variables `gain` and `speed`:
    ```{r}
    flights_sml <- 
      select(flights, year:day, ends_with("delay"), distance, air_time)
    flights_sml
    ```
    ```{r}
    mutate(flights_sml,
      gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
      speed = distance / air_time * 60
    )
    ```

----

- Refer to columns that you’ve just created:
    ```{r}
    mutate(flights_sml,
      gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
      hours = air_time %/% 60,
      minute = air_time %% 60,
      gain_per_hour = gain / (hours + minute / 60)
    )
    ```


Modular arithmetic: `%/%` (integer division) and `%%` (remainder).

----

- Only keep the new variables by `transmute()`:
    ```{r}
    transmute(flights,
      gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
      hours = air_time %/% 60,
      minute = air_time %% 60,
      gain_per_hour = gain / (hours + minute / 60)
    )
    ```

----

- `across()`: apply a function (or a set of functions) to a set of columns
    ```{r}
    flights %>%
      transmute(across(1:4, list(log = log, log2 = log2)))
    ```

-  apply funs of one type
    ```{r}
    flights %>%
      filter(dep_delay > 0 & arr_delay > 0) %>%
      transmute(across(where(is.numeric), log))
    ```

# Summaries

`summarise()` collapses a data frame to a single row.

- Not very useful unless paired with `group_by()`.

- `group_by()` changes the unit of the analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups.

- Mean of a variable:
    ```{r}
    (by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day))
    summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
    ```

----
 
- Convert a tibble into a grouped tibble:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    (by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day))
    ```
    
----

- Grouped summaries:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
    ```

## Pipe

- Consider following analysis:
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
    delay <- summarise(by_dest, count = n(),
      dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
      delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
    delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dest != "HNL")
    delay
    ```
    
----

- Cleaner code using pipe `%>%`:
    ```{r}
    delays <- flights %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      summarise(
        count = n(),
        dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
        delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
      ) %>% 
      filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
    delays
    ```
    
----

- ggplot2 accepts pipe too.
    ```{r}
    delays %>%
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
      geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

## Other summary functions

- Location: `mean(x)`, `median(x)`.
    ```{r}
    not_cancelled <- flights %>% filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
    not_cancelled
    ```
    ```{r}
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
      summarise(
        avg_delay1 = mean(arr_delay),
        avg_delay2 = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay > 0]) # the average positive delay
      )
    ```
    
----

- Spread: `sd(x)`, `IQR(x)`, `mad(x)`.
    ```{r}
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      summarise(distance_sd = sd(distance)) %>% 
      arrange(desc(distance_sd))
    ```

----
    
- Rank: `min(x)`, `quantile(x, 0.25)`, `max(x)`.
    ```{r}
    # When do the first and last flights leave each day?
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
      summarise(
        first = min(dep_time),
        last = max(dep_time)
      )
    ```

----

- Position: `first(x)`, `nth(x, 2)`, `last(x)`.
    ```{r}
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
      summarise(
        first_dep = first(dep_time), 
        last_dep = last(dep_time)
      )
    ```

----

- Count: `n(x)`, `sum(!is.na(x))`, `n_distinct(x)`.
    ```{r}
    # Which destinations have the most carriers?
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      summarise(carriers = n_distinct(carrier)) %>% 
      arrange(desc(carriers))
    ```

----

- 
    ```{r}
    not_cancelled %>% 
      count(dest)
    ```

---- 

- 
    ```{r}
    not_cancelled %>% 
      count(tailnum, wt = distance)
    ```

----

-
    ```{r}
    # How many flights left before 5am? (these usually indicate delayed
    # flights from the previous day)
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
      summarise(n_early = sum(dep_time < 500))
    ```

----

-
    ```{r}
    # What proportion of flights are delayed by more than an hour?
    not_cancelled %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
      summarise(hour_perc = mean(arr_delay > 60))
    ```

## Grouped mutates (and filters)

- Recall the `flights_sml` tibble created earlier:
    ```{r}
    flights_sml
    ```

- Find the worst members of each group:
    ```{r}
    flights_sml %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day) %>%
      filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) < 10)
    ```
    
----

- Find all groups bigger than a threshold:
    ```{r}
    (popular_dests <- flights %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      filter(n() > 365))
    ```
    
----

- Standardise to compute per group metrics:
    ```{r}
    popular_dests %>% 
      filter(arr_delay > 0) %>% 
      mutate(prop_delay = arr_delay / sum(arr_delay)) %>% 
      select(year:day, dest, arr_delay, prop_delay)
    ```
