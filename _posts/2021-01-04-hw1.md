## Problem 1

Using Table 1, find the parsimony score for each of the fifteen possible unrooted trees containg the first five taxa.


Table 1: First 30 bps of the mitochrondrial cytochrome _b_ gene for ten mammals.
```
Dolphin      ATG ACC AAC ATC CGA AAA ACA CAC CCT CTA
Hippopotamus ATG ACA AAC ATC CGA AAA TCT CAC CCC TTA
Camel        ATG ACA AAC ATC CGA AAA TCA CAC CCA CTT
Cow          ATG ACT AAC ATT CGA AAG TCC CAC CCA CTA
Giraffe      ATG ATC AAC ATC CGA AAG TCC CAC CCA CTA

Sperm whale  ATG ACC AAC ATC CGA AAA TCA CAC CCA TTA
Blue whale   ATG ACC AAC ATC CGA AAA ACA CAC CCA CTA
Pig          ATG ACC AAC ATC CGA AAA TCA CAC CCA CTA
Sheep        ATG ATC AAC ATC CGA AAA ACC CAC CCA CTA
Goat         ATG ACC AAC ATC CGA AAG ACC CAC CCA TTA
```

## Problem 2

A site is said to be _phylogenetically informative_ if the parsimony score of that site is variable over the set of possible trees.  Prove that a site is phylogenetically informative if and only if the site pattern contains at least two different letters that each appear at least twice.

## Problem 3

Use the Fitch algorithm to the find the parsimony score for each of the phylogenetically informative sites using all of the data in Table 1 for the following tree:

```
(((Dolphin,S.whale),B.whale),((Hippo,Pig),(((Cow,(Sheep,Goat)),Giraffe),Camel)));
```

## Problem 4

Pick any of the possible unrooted trees for the ten taxa in Table 1 uniformly at random.  What is the probability that the tree contains Dolphin, Sperm Whale and Blue Whale as a _clade? (In other words, what is the probability that the tree contains an edge that _splits_ these three taxa from the remaining seven?)
